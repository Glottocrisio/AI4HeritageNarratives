1. Inattentional Blindness Eect - The phenomenon where people fail to notice
unexpected stimuli when focused on a specic task [125]. - Implementation in
narrative theory: Background information can be leveraged to enhance surprisal
spikes; crucial plot elements can be hidden in plain sight. - Computational Implementation:
Narrative generation systems can strategically place important information
in contexts where readersâ€™ attention is directed elsewhere, setting up future
revelations.
2. Perceived Enjoyment - The extent to which an activity is perceived as enjoyable
in its own right [44]. - Implementation in narrative theory: This is to be implemented
in the part of story creation (not fruition) - The user becomes a better storyteller
in the process. - Computational Implementation: Interactive narrative systems can
adapt to user preferences, providing positive feedback and increasing engagement
with the creative process.
3. Perceived Usefulness - The degree to which a person believes that using a particular
system would enhance their performance [44]. - Implementation in narrative
theory: This is to be implemented in the part of story creation (not fruition). -
Computational Implementation: Systems can demonstrate utility by helping users
overcome common narrative challenges (e.g., plot holes, character development).
4. Perceived Ease of Use - The degree to which a person believes that using a system
would be free of effort [44]. - Implementation in narrative theory: This is to
be implemented in the part of story creation (not fruition). - Computational Implementation:

load while maintaining creative exibility.
5. Picture Superiority Effect - The phenomenon where pictures and images are
more likely to be remembered than words [156]. - Implementation in narrative theory:
Add pictures to the story (intertextuality). Explore ways to intertwine the two
in interesting ways. - Computational Implementation: Multimodal narrative systems
that can suggest relevant visual content or generate complementary imagery
based on textual descriptions.
6. Barnum Effect - Also known as the Forer Effect, where individuals believe that personality
descriptions apply specifically to them despite the description being vague
and general enough to apply to a wide range of people [65]. - Implementation in
narrative theory: Craft character traits and situations that allow readers to identify
with characters through strategic ambiguity. - Computational Implementation:
Generate character descriptions with calibrated levels of specicity that maximize
reader identification.

7. Diderot Effect - The observation that acquiring a new possession often creates a
spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases [138]. - Implementation in
narrative theory: Character development can mirror this pattern, where one change
in behavior or circumstance necessitates further transformations. - Computational
Implementation: Plot generation algorithms can model cascading effects of character
decisions, creating organic complexity in narrative development.
8. Zeigarnik Effect - The psychological tendency to remember uncompleted tasks
better than completed ones [232]. - Implementation in narrative theory: Deliberately
leave certain storylines unresolved temporarily to increase memorability and
reader engagement. - Computational Implementation: Track narrative threads and
strategically maintain optimal ratios of resolved to unresolved elements based on
reader attention models.
9. IKEA Effect - People place disproportionally higher value on products they partially
created themselves [157]. - Implementation in narrative theory: Allow readers
to participate in creating aspects of the narrative, increasing their investment in
the story. - Computational Implementation: Interactive storytelling systems that
incorporate reader choices while maintaining narrative coherence and quality.
10. Mere Exposure Effect - The tendency to develop a preference for things merely
because they are familiar [231]. - Implementation in narrative theory: Recurring
elements, characters, or locations can create comfort and attachment for readers
over time. - Computational Implementation: Algorithms can track and modulate
the reintroduction of narrative elements to optimize familiarity without creating
repetitiveness.
11. Context-Dependent Memory - The phenomenon where memories are more easily
retrieved when the context during recall matches the context during encoding
[75]. - Implementation in narrative theory: Setting consistent emotional or physical
contexts for related narrative elements can enhance thematic connections and
memorability. - Computational Implementation: Systems can track contextual features
of narrative moments and strategically recreate these contexts when reintroducing
related elements.
12. Story Bias - The tendency to interpret information as being part of a larger narrative,
even when the events are unrelated [206]. - Implementation in narrative
theory: Leverage readersâ€™ tendency to nd patterns by planting seemingly unrelated
elements that later converge meaningfully. - Computational Implementation:
Narrative generation can include strategically placed elements that appear random
but follow hidden patterns, rewarding attentive readers.
13. Von Restorff Effect - The observation that distinctive items are more likely to be
remembered than common items [218]. - Implementation in narrative theory: Create
memorable moments through disruption of established patterns or expectations. -

novel elements or variations that contrast with established narrative patterns.
3.8. Narrativiting Knowledge Graphs 73
14. Authenticity Bias - The preference for experiences perceived as genuine or real
rather than articial or contrived [14]. - Implementation in narrative theory: Develop
narratives with imperfections and limitations that mirror real-world constraints.
- Computational Implementation: Narrative generation systems can introduce
calculated aws and limitations that enhance perceived authenticity rather
than aiming for idealized perfectionism.
15. Uncanny Valley Effect - The hypothesis that human replicas that appear almost
but not quite human elicit feelings of eeriness and revulsion [148]. - Implementation
in narrative theory: Can be used deliberately to create discomfort with characters
or situations that seem almost normal but contain subtle wrongness. - Computational
Implementation: Character development algorithms can introduce calculated
deviations from expected human behavior to create specic emotional responses.
16. Aesthetic-Usability Effect - The tendency for users to perceive aesthetically pleasing
designs as more usable [210]. - Implementation in narrative theory: Well-crafted
prose and structural elegance can enhance readersâ€™ perception of narrative quality
and meaning. - Computational Implementation: Style transfer algorithms and linguistic
quality metrics can enhance subjective reading experience while preserving
content.
17. Paradox of Choice - The theory that an abundance of options can make individuals
less satised with their nal choice [195]. - Implementation in narrative theory:
Limiting narrative paths or character options can sometimes create more satisfying
experiences than unlimited choice. - Computational Implementation: Interactive
narratives can offer meaningful but constrained choices that preserve narrative
quality rather than overwhelming users with possibilities.
18. Processing Fluency Effect - The ease with which information is processed in-
uences judgments about that information [4]. - Implementation in narrative theory:
Adjusting the complexity of prose to match content (simpler for action, more
complex for introspection) can enhance reader immersion. - Computational Implementation:
Readability algorithms can modulate linguistic complexity based on
narrative context and desired cognitive effect.
19. Bizarreness Effect - Unusual or bizarre material is better remembered than common
material [96]. - Implementation in narrative theory: Strategic use of surprising
or unconventional elements can create memorable narrative moments. - Computational
Implementation: Creative divergence algorithms can generate unusual narrative
elements calibrated to specic reader tolerance thresholds.
NARRATIVE
â€¢ Presentation Strategies

24. Cognitive Closure: Resolving conicts or providing explanations at the end of a
narrative satises readersâ€™ desire for closure and contributes to their overall satisfaction.
25. Sensory Language and Synesthesia: Describing sensory experiences using rich,
evocative language can trigger readersâ€™ sensory memories and engage multiple
senses.
26. False Memories: Introducing unreliable or distorted memories in the narrative
can mirror the way human memory can be fallible, creating intrigue and tension.
