# The Jackal's Watch

Elena stuffed the last of her clothes into her backpack and zipped it shut. Three months in Naples, and all she had to show for it was a half-finished dissertation and a broken heart. Marco's text message still burned in her mind: "I need space. Maybe when you're back from America."

She glanced around the small apartment one last time, making sure she hadn't forgotten anything. Her eyes fell on the postcard she'd bought at the National Archaeological Museum—a small Anubis amulet from the 7th century BCE, the jackal-headed god standing on a rectangular base with a dorsal pillar for suspension. She'd kept it on her desk during her research stay, a small talisman against loneliness.

Elena slipped the postcard into her pocket. She would need all the protection she could get for the journey ahead.

At the airport, a security guard with tired eyes waved her through the metal detector. Elena checked her watch—still two hours before boarding. She wandered into a café and ordered an espresso, her last taste of real Italian coffee before returning to the watery American version.

"Mind if I join you?" The woman gestured to the empty chair at Elena's table. "Everywhere else is full."

Elena nodded, not particularly wanting company but too polite to refuse. The woman settled across from her, arranging her bags around her chair.

"I'm Sophia," she said, extending her hand. 

"Elena."

"American? Here for vacation?"

"Research, actually. I'm finishing my PhD in Mediterranean trade networks. Or trying to, anyway." Elena sipped her coffee. "You?"

"I live here." Sophia smiled. "But I was born in Alexandria. My family moved when I was twelve."

"Alexandria?" Elena straightened. "I was just studying Alexandrian trade artifacts."

"Then we were destined to meet." Sophia laughed, the sound warm and unexpected in the sterile airport environment. "My grandfather ran an antiquities shop before the regulations changed. He was always telling me stories about Anubis guiding souls between worlds."

Elena reached into her pocket and pulled out the postcard. "Like this one?"

Sophia's eyes widened. "Exactly like that! My grandfather had a bronze one about this size." She indicated with her fingers. "He said it was a guide for those caught between places."

"Well, that's me. Caught between places." Elena tucked the postcard away. "Not sure where I belong anymore."

"Perhaps you need guidance rather than protection," Sophia said. "That's really what Anubis offered—not just guarding the dead, but showing them the way forward."

The final boarding call for Sophia's flight interrupted their conversation. As she gathered her things, she scribbled something on a napkin.

"My email. If you ever return to Naples, or if you need help with your research on Alexandria..." She smiled. "Sometimes the best path forward is one we didn't plan."

On the plane, Elena found herself unable to sleep. She kept thinking about Sophia's words. Guidance rather than protection. The way forward. She pulled out her laptop and opened her dissertation file, staring at the half-finished chapter on cultural hybridization in Mediterranean trade items.

For the first time in months, words began to flow. By the time the plane landed in New York, she had outlined a completely new approach to her research—focusing not on the items themselves, but on the paths they traveled and the people who carried them between worlds.

Six months later, when she returned to Naples to complete her fieldwork, the first email she sent was to Sophia. The second was to Marco, declining his offer to reconnect. She had found her path forward, and it didn't lead backward anymore.

# The Battle on the Wall

The first time Jason noticed the drawing, he was trying to ignore his mother's boyfriend as they toured the National Archaeological Museum of Naples. At fourteen, Jason had perfected the art of seeming completely uninterested in anything adults wanted him to see.

"This is from Pompeii," his mother said, pointing to a large drawing of a battle scene. "It's based on a mosaic showing Alexander the Great fighting against King Darius."

Jason glanced up despite himself. The drawing showed warriors on horseback, one man clearly about to spear another. It was actually kind of brutal, not the boring art he'd expected.

"Whatever," he mumbled, but he lingered longer than he had at any other exhibit.

That night, back at the rented apartment, Jason couldn't sleep. His mother and Paolo were arguing in the kitchen, their voices rising and falling in a familiar pattern. The walls were too thin, the language barrier between Jason and Paolo too thick, and the summer heat oppressive even with the windows open.

Jason closed his eyes and thought about the drawing he'd seen. Alexander the Great charging forward on horseback while chaos erupted around him. There had been something in the warrior's expression—a kind of absolute certainty. Jason couldn't remember the last time he'd felt certain about anything.

The next morning, his mother announced that Paolo had to return to Rome for work. "It's just us for the next three days," she said, trying to sound cheerful. Jason noticed the redness around her eyes.

"Can we go back to the museum?" he asked, surprising himself.

His mother looked equally surprised. "Of course."

They spent the afternoon in the museum, but this time Jason paid attention. He stood for nearly thirty minutes in front of the battle drawing, noticing details he'd missed before—the tree in the background, the soldier being trampled under a chariot wheel, the way the artist had reconstructed damaged sections of the original mosaic.

"Did he win?" Jason asked.

"Alexander? Yes." His mother stood beside him. "He conquered most of the known world by the time he was thirty-two."

"But he's outnumbered here," Jason pointed out.

"Sometimes it's not about numbers," she said. "It's about conviction. Alexander never doubted he would win, even when the odds were against him."

That night, Jason heard his mother crying softly in her bedroom. He stood outside her door, uncertain whether to knock. The image of Alexander came to mind—charging forward despite the chaos.

Jason knocked gently and pushed the door open. "Mom? Are you okay?"

She wiped her eyes quickly. "I'm fine, sweetie."

"No, you're not." He sat on the edge of her bed. "And that's okay. But you don't have to do this alone."

His mother looked startled, then smiled through her tears. "When did you get so wise?"

"There was this drawing of a battle," Jason said. "It made me think about bravery. Not the stupid kind where you pretend nothing hurts, but the real kind where you know something's hard and you do it anyway."

She hugged him tightly. "I'm sorry about Paolo. About all the Paolos. I keep making the same mistakes."

"We'll figure it out," Jason said. "Together."

Back home in Chicago two weeks later, Jason asked for a poster of the Alexander Mosaic for his bedroom wall. Each morning, he looked at the ancient battle before heading to school—a reminder that even when outnumbered, moving forward with conviction was sometimes all that mattered.

# The Statuette

The email arrived on a Tuesday, buried between faculty meeting reminders and student excuses for late papers. Professor Simon Chen almost deleted it with the others, but the subject line caught his attention: "Regarding your grandfather's collection."

Simon clicked it open, curious. His grandfather had died twenty years ago, leaving a modest collection of books and artifacts from his archaeological career. Nothing valuable—just personal mementos from excavations in the 1950s and 60s.

The message was from an Italian museum curator named Gabriella Ricci:

"Dr. Chen, I am researching the provenance of several matrices created by Francesco Cepparoli and Giovanni Battista Casanova in the 18th century, documenting a statuette of Alexander the Great on horseback. Our records indicate your grandfather, Dr. James Chen, examined these matrices in 1964 and may have left research notes that could assist our conservation efforts. If you have access to his papers, I would be most grateful for any information."

Simon leaned back in his chair, thinking of the boxes in his attic, untouched since his grandfather's death. He'd always meant to sort through them, but his own career as a chemistry professor had kept him busy, and his grandfather's archaeological interests had seemed remote from his scientific world.

That evening, Simon climbed into the attic and found the boxes labeled "James Chen - Professional Papers." Dust scattered as he lifted the first lid, revealing neatly organized folders. His grandfather had been methodical, at least.

In the third box, he found a folder labeled "Naples, 1964." Inside were yellowed pages of notes, sketches, and several black and white photographs showing what appeared to be metal plates with etched designs.

"Remarkable precision in the posterior view," his grandfather had written. "Attention to musculature suggests the engraver had anatomical training. Compare with similar technique in the Anubis documentation from the same period."

Simon sorted through the papers, finding more detailed observations and measurements. His grandfather had been assisting with a chemical analysis of the metal composition, bringing his background in materials science to the archaeological research. The interdisciplinary approach had been unusual for its time.

As Simon read through the notes, he felt an unexpected connection forming across the decades. His grandfather's blending of chemistry and archaeology mirrored Simon's own recent interest in applying advanced chemical analysis to historical artifacts—a side interest he'd barely mentioned to his colleagues.

Beneath the folder of notes, Simon discovered a small, carefully wrapped package. Inside was a bronze statuette about six inches tall. A small card in his grandfather's handwriting explained: "Replica of the Alexander statuette, created based on Cepparoli's matrices. Gift from the Naples Museum, 1964."

Simon held the small horseman in his palm, noting the careful attention to detail on both rider and mount. It was beautiful craftsmanship, capturing a sense of movement and purpose.

The next morning, Simon replied to Gabriella's email, attaching scans of his grandfather's notes and photographs. He mentioned the replica statuette and offered to share any other materials she might find useful.

Her response came within hours:

"Dr. Chen, these notes are extraordinary! Your grandfather's chemical analysis helps answer questions we've been debating for years about the manufacturing process. Would you consider collaborating on a paper combining your chemical expertise with our historical research? The intersection of chemistry and archaeology could provide new insights into 18th-century documentation techniques."

Simon smiled as he typed his reply. His grandfather had found his path at the intersection of scientific analysis and historical understanding. Perhaps it was time for Simon to explore that borderland as well.

When he placed the small bronze statuette on his office desk, students began asking about it. For the first time, Simon found himself sharing stories about his grandfather's work, bridging chemistry and history in ways that made both subjects come alive.

# The Temple Drawings

Maya's grandmother had always been difficult, but dementia made her impossible. The doctors called it sundowning—the way she became agitated and confused as evening approached. Today had been particularly bad, with Nonna insisting that someone was stealing from her, hiding things in the walls of the nursing home.

"I need to go home," she kept saying. "They're hiding my drawings."

"Nonna, you've lived here for three years," Maya reminded her, trying to keep her voice gentle despite her exhaustion. "Your apartment was sold, remember?"

"Not that home," her grandmother snapped. "Naples. My real home."

Maya sighed. Her grandmother had left Italy in 1960, bringing her young husband to America and never returning, not even for her parents' funerals. Whatever attachment she claimed to feel for Naples now was surely a fiction of her failing mind.

"Why don't we look at some pictures?" Maya suggested, pulling out her phone. She had downloaded photos of Naples, hoping they might soothe her grandmother's agitation.

As she scrolled through images of the bay, the castle, the crowded streets, her grandmother remained restless. But when Maya showed her a picture of the National Archaeological Museum, something changed in the old woman's expression.

"That's where they are," she whispered. "The temple drawings."

"What temple drawings, Nonna?"

"The ones my father made. Copies of the old ones. The Temple of Isis with Anubis."

Maya frowned. Her great-grandfather had been an artist of some kind, she knew that much, but no one had ever mentioned museum work or Egyptian temples.

"Vincenzo Campana and Carlo Nolli made the originals in the 18th century," her grandmother continued, her voice suddenly clear and precise. "My father was commissioned to create reproductions in 1940 when they feared the originals might be damaged in the war. He signed them with his initials only—G.C. Gabriele Caruso."

Maya stared at her grandmother, shocked by the sudden lucidity and the specific details. "Nonna, how do you remember all this?"

"Some things you don't forget." Her grandmother's hands twisted in her lap. "My father died in the bombing in 1943. I was fourteen. They never found his body, but the drawings survived. They're still there in the museum, but no one knows who made them. No one remembers him."

That night, Maya wrote to the museum, explaining her grandmother's story and asking if there were indeed reproduction drawings of the Temple of Isis with Anubis made in 1940, possibly signed with the initials G.C.

She expected nothing, perhaps a form letter in response. Instead, two weeks later, she received an email from the curator of documents and drawings:

"Ms. Caruso, your email was passed to me for response. We do indeed have a set of reproduction drawings created in 1940 documenting the Temple of Isis with Anubis artifacts. They are remarkable for their precision and artistic quality, and we have long wondered about their creator, as they are signed only with the initials G.C. If your grandfather was indeed Gabriele Caruso, you have solved a small mystery for our collection."

Attached to the email were photographs of the drawings—detailed renderings of architectural elements showing Egyptian motifs adapted to Roman settings. They were beautiful, precise yet somehow personal in their execution.

Maya printed the images and brought them to her grandmother the next day. For the first time in months, the old woman's hands were steady as she held the printouts.

"He always said art was how we remember," she said softly. "How we keep the dead alive."

That evening, when sundowning would normally begin, Maya's grandmother remained calm, the printouts arranged neatly on her bedside table. She told stories about her father's studio, how he taught her to mix pigments, the smell of his cigarettes and turpentine.

Three months later, Maya stood in the National Archaeological Museum in Naples, looking at the original drawings by Campana and Nolli, and beside them, the 1940 reproductions by her great-grandfather. The museum had added a small placard acknowledging Gabriele Caruso's work and its importance in preserving the visual record during wartime.

"We keep the dead alive," Maya whispered, understanding at last what her grandmother had meant. Not just the ancient Egyptians with their elaborate rituals and jackal-headed guides to the afterlife, but all of us, remembering those who came before, honoring their work, speaking their names.

# The Dog-Headed God

Jack Sullivan knew he was dreaming, but that didn't make the figure any less terrifying. It stood in the corner of the hospital room—a man's body with a dog's head, tall ears pointed upward, eyes fixed on Jack's father in the bed.

"Get away from him," Jack tried to say, but his dream-voice made no sound.

The figure turned, regarding Jack with ancient eyes. "I am not here for him yet," it seemed to say, though its jackal jaws didn't move. "Only watching. That is my duty."

Jack jerked awake, his neck stiff from sleeping in the hospital chair. His father's breath rattled, shallow but regular. The monitors beeped steadily. No dog-headed figures lurked in corners.

"Bad dream?" The night nurse checked his father's IV.

"Yeah." Jack rubbed his eyes. "Something about a dog man watching my dad."

The nurse's hands paused briefly. "Anubis," she said. "Egyptian god of the dead. Guides souls to the afterlife."

"Great," Jack muttered. "Super comforting."

"Actually, it is," the nurse said, surprising him. "Anubis wasn't evil. He protected spirits on their journey. Made sure they arrived safely." She adjusted his father's blanket. "My parents were Egyptian. We had a statue of him in our house growing up."

After she left, Jack couldn't get back to sleep. He pulled out his phone and searched for "Anubis." Images appeared—ancient paintings and statues of the jackal-headed god. One result caught his attention: "First-century BCE statue of Anubis, National Archaeological Museum of Naples."

The statue showed the god standing with one leg slightly advanced, the posture more natural than the rigid Egyptian images. According to the museum description, it represented Hellenistic influence on Egyptian religious iconography.

Jack wasn't religious or superstitious. As a software engineer, he prided himself on logical thinking. But three nights in the hospital watching his father struggle after heart surgery had left him raw and open to strange thoughts.

He found himself reading about ancient Egyptian beliefs, how Anubis guided souls to judgment, how he protected them from dangers on the journey. In one myth, Anubis restored the dead god Osiris, making resurrection possible.

Jack must have dozed off again while reading because the dog-headed figure returned in his dreams, this time standing beside the bed.

"What do you want?" Jack asked, and this time his voice worked.

"To guide," the figure answered. "That is my purpose."

"He's not ready," Jack said.

"That is not for you to decide. Nor for me. I only guide when the time comes."

"And if I don't believe in you?"

The jackal head tilted. "Belief changes nothing. I guided souls before humans learned to write my name. I will guide them after your cities turn to dust."

Jack woke with a jolt as his father called his name. For the first time in days, the old man's eyes were clear, focused.

"Dad?" Jack leaned forward, took his hand. "How are you feeling?"

"Had the strangest dream," his father said, voice raspy but stronger than it had been. "Dog-headed fellow telling me it wasn't my time yet. Said I needed to finish something first." He squeezed Jack's hand. "Told me to stop being so stubborn about moving in with you and Susan after I recover."

Jack laughed, tension breaking. "Sounds like a smart dog-headed fellow."

That evening, when the doctor came by, she seemed pleasantly surprised by his father's improvement. "Sometimes they turn a corner when we least expect it," she said. "Whatever's happening, it's working."

After she left, Jack's father drifted back to sleep. In the quiet room, Jack thought he saw a shadow move in the corner—tall ears, pointed snout. Just a trick of the light, he told himself. Nothing more.

But later, when he stepped into the hospital corridor to call his wife with the good news, he whispered a quick thank you to the empty air. Just in case.

Three months later, Jack helped his father move into their converted garage apartment. Among the housewarming gifts was a small replica of the Naples museum's Anubis statue. Jack placed it on the shelf beside his father's bed—a guardian for the journey, whatever that might be.
